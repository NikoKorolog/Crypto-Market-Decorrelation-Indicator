Based on my previous work with crypto index average, I theorized that the whole market moves more or less at the same time and that divergence from this average motion is tradable alpha,
similar to pairs trading, except that instead of trading two assets agains each other it trades one volatile asset against a less volatile index average. I say less volatile because the
relative motion of the constituent index elements theoretically average out (I think)
So I plotted the scaled price of an indiviual asset against the scaled average of an index of top altcoins to visualize when the asset's relative motion diverges from he market as a whole.
I also plotted the divergence from that average motion, and a rolling correlation coefficient, and used those two components to create an indicator that tells when to buy. If the rolling
correlation coefficient is low and the negative divergence from the market average is high, it signals a buy, because we expect the motion to reconverge upward (reversion to the mean)
and if the correlation coefficient is high and positive divergence is high it signals a sell, because we expect the motion to reconverge downward. The signals generated by this algo
correlate really nicely with big market movements and spikes in price over a long period of time. 

The way I would trade this is dollar cost average in on all the buy signals and then dollar cost average out on sell signals, or even dump the whole trade on the first sell signal.
Just based upon how it looks if you traded on this it would result in profit.

The next step for this strategy is back-testing which I will do in my next project
